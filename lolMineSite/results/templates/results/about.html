	<h1>LET'S TALK ABOUT US</h1>
    <div style="width:96%; margin: auto;">
<h2 style="margin-top: -20px;">We are a startup using Riot API and <mark>magic </mark></h2><h2 style="margin-top: -18px;">to make your <mark>game experience better</mark></h2>
<h3 style="font-size:22px;">Riot uses an algorithm to match you with your teammates on the same skill level <mark>(yes, toxic ones too)</mark>.
According to algorithm, every player has a <mark>MMR</mark> (Match Making Rating) calculated based on different factors.
However, MMR system has its weaknesses. In traditional way, you may have the same MMR
with a player <mark>who did not play for last 3 months</mark>, or a player <mark>who lost his/her last 9 games out of 10.</mark></h3><br>
<h3 style="margin-top: -10px; font-size:22px;">You can only climb ranks if everyone on the team want to win, and take action to climb the rank.
You can't choose everyone in the Solo/Duo Queue. But you can choose <mark>one.</mark></h3>
<h3 style="margin-top: -10px;"><mark>We are here to help you find </mark>the best <mark>teammate, listening for your needs.</mark></h3>
